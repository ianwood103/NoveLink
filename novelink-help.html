              NoveLink is an online publishing platform that allows for authors
              to publish their works to the Internet in a free, yet highly proffessional
              environment. By keeping many works of literature all in the same place
              for free, NoveLink also allows for readers to access certain works of
              their favorite authors at no additional cost. <br>
              <br>
              Since both authors and users can have publicly visible accounts, NoveLink
              allows for fans to directly communicate with and support their favorite
              authors along with creating discussions with their peers. Users can also
              create and join guilds, which act as an online discussion area for certain topics.

              NoveLink is a technology platform that seeks to link various peoples
              around the globe as well as grow the influence and success of small
              authors through the unifying power of literature. NoveLink does this
              by incorporating its strong values of keeping literature free and
              accessible to everyone as well as providing an enjoyable, ad-free
              experience. NoveLink is fueled by contributors who share a love for

              As of right now, it is not a 'we', it is a 'me'. Just me. Not a team or anything.
              But, I thought it would still be good to tell everyone a little about myself. My
              name is Ian Wood, and I am currently a sophomore in high school in an area about
              half an hour north of Atlanta, Georgia. I have been here basically my whole life
              and, while living here, I have slowly gained a love for books and coding. I have
              long since been thinking of ways to combine the two and now I have this, NoveLink.
              Hopefully this little thing works out, but then again, if you're reading this, it
              probably has.
